						Added "ImageCropper" by <a href="http://swing-fx.blogspot.com/2008/04/swing-component-to-crop-images.html">Christophe Le Besnerais</a>.  Christophe gave the ok to commit his code to SwingFX, so now it is in the source.  There a few bugs that need to be worked out, but hopefully udpates will be provided soon.

						Added a new feature to SwingFX called Rubber Band.  It contains a simple API which allows
						for the easy creation of rubber bands.  Included in the net.java.swingfx.rubberband.demo is
						a Main class which is a simple demo of the rubber bands which are included and a description
						on how to get started creating your own.

            I just added the <code>PerformanceInfiniteProgressPanel</code> <i>Henry Story</i> has been kind to heavily tweak. It can be found in the <code>net.java.swingfx.waitwithstyle</code> package. I also finally added the Ant build file kindly provided by <i>Marty Backe</i>.
            <br /><br />
            <i>Christopher Atlan</i> also worked on a very cool search field component based upon an OS X-like border I wrote for Swing and shown in one of my demos on my blog. There is an issue to be fixed before the component actually reaches the CVS repository but it should happen within a few days (depending on the amount of time Christopher can find to fix it).
            <br /><br />
            My next tasks will be:<br />
            <ul>
            <li>Clean up my <a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/gfx/20050217#search_with_style_in_swing">Spotlight demo</a> source code to move it to SwingFX</li>
            <li>Document <code>PerformanceInfiniteProgressPanel</code> and enrich the API to give more control over the appearance</li>
            <li>Promote <code>PerformanceInfiniteProgressPanel</code> to InfiniteProgressPanel and get rid of the old one</li>
            <li>Merge high performance <code>InfiniteProgressPanel</code> code with <a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/slobodan">Slobodan Celenkovic</a> progress components which are much more versatile than SwingFX's panel</li>
            </ul>

						and I am working on a fading progress bar.  Any suggestions or ideas?  Please feel free to contact us.
